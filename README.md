[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/sabryp3/HiveBox/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/sabryp3/HiveBox)
Overview
HiveBox is a FastAPI-based application designed to monitor and aggregate the temperature readings from three specified sensors. It provides API endpoints to retrieve sensor temperatures, calculate the average, store the result in a Minio bucket, check sensor readiness, and report the application version. The app uses Redis for caching and is built for deployment on AWS EKS, leveraging Kubernetes manifests and a Dockerized workflow. CI/CD automation and security are integrated through GitHub Actions.

Features
/temperature: Retrieve the average temperature from three sensors. Returns a qualitative assessment ("Too cold", "Good", "Too hot") based on the average.
/version: Displays the current application version.
/store: Triggers upload of the cached average temperature to a public Minio bucket.
/readyz: Readiness probe endpoint, verifies sensor availability.
/metrics: Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring.
Redis Caching: Caches the average temperature for efficient repeated access.
Scheduled Minio Upload: Automatically uploads cached averages to Minio every 5 minutes.
Project Structure
main.py: Main FastAPI application, implements all API endpoints and business logic.
Dockerfile: Multi-stage Docker build for lightweight and secure containerization.
k8s/: Kubernetes manifests for deploying the app, Redis, and Prometheus, and publishing services through NGINX ingress on EKS.
.github/workflows/: GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation, infrastructure deployment, and security scanning.
version.py: Contains the app’s version string.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies for the app.
.env: Environment variable definitions (not committed to repo).
API Endpoints
GET /temperature: Returns average temperature status from the three sensors.
GET /version: Returns current software version.
GET /store: Stores the cached average temperature in Minio bucket.
GET /readyz: Checks readiness of the sensors.
GET /metrics: Prometheus metrics endpoint (auto-exposed).
Deployment
Docker
Build and run the application container:

sh
docker build -t hivebox-app .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 hivebox-app
Kubernetes/EKS
Apply the manifests from the k8s/ folder to deploy the application, Redis, and Prometheus.
The NGINX ingress controller publishes the endpoints.
CI/CD automation is set via GitHub Actions for both application and infrastructure deployment.
CI/CD & Security
CI/CD Pipeline: Automated build, test, and deployment via GitHub Actions.
Security Workflows: Includes secret scanning, dependency review, and other best-practice security checks (see .github/workflows/ for details).
Requirements
Python 3.9+
Redis
Minio (public bucket)
Docker (for containerization)
Kubernetes (for orchestration, tested on EKS)
Prometheus (for monitoring)
NGINX Ingress Controller
Environment Variables
The following environment variables should be configured (typically in .env):

REDIS_URL
BOXES (comma-separated sensor IDs)
BOXES_URL (base API URL for sensors)
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY
MINIO_SECRET_KEY
